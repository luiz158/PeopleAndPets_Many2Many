## Important annotations

```@Entity```

```@OneToMany``` Defines a many-vaued association with one-to-many multiplicity

```@ManyToOne``` Defines a single-valued association to another entity class that has many-to-one multiplicity

```@OneToMany``` Defines a single-valued association to another entity class that has one-to-many multiplicity

```@ManyToMany``` defines a many-valued association with many-to-many multiplicity

```mappedBy``` references the field that ```owns``` the relationship in the referenced entity. This is generally required.


## Fetching Strategies - define how object hierarchies are loaded

```EAGER``` - loads all related objects immediately

```LAZY``` - loads the related objects only if they are accessed for the first time


## This project contains two branches (plus master):

* One2Many

* Many2Many

The master branch is the default project which is the same as Many2Many. It illustrates how to create a ManyToMany relationship where one pet has many owners and each owner can own many pets.

The One2Many branch illusrates how to work around the complications of the Many2Many relationship by creating two one2many relationships.

use ```git checkout One2Many``` to checkout that branch and observe how the project changes when designing the database this way.
